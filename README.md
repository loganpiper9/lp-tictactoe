# lp-tictactoe
TicTacToe made with Javascript Canvas
This is a copy of a TicTacToe game I wrote while attending a coding camp back last summer
I threw it together in an hour, and the code was rather unorganized with no comments and the game was a simple canvas on a white background
This is my improvement of the old version, with prettier graphics, and improved game logic
